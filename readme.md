## About this Repository

This repository serves as placeholder for the Geek Asylum community platform. This is written in php using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). In the future this will be upgraded to a modular system. Current stuff that is planned before major release:

- Registration and Authentication
- Register using multiple different game systems (Eve Online, World of Warcraft, League of Legends)
- Connect ingame characters to your user profile
- User management through ACL systems
- Blogging
- Forum
- Full Administrative control
- Discord Bot
- Social Media integration (like blog entries, share them on facebook/twitter)
- And more as the platform grows
